# LaneLineDetection

Recognizing the lanes of the road is what every human car driver does to keep the car in the constraints of the lane. Computer systems are also able to identify lane lines. In this repository is a simple method described how to implement a system using computer vision techniques. I use a pipeline to get a video ouput showing the identified lane lines using python and opencv.
